# Resources

Inspired by [Pajn](https://github.com/Pajn/collected-thoughts) I decided to start collect my own resources somewhere. This will be both stuff that I want to have close at hand, stuff I want to be able to come back to but also stuff I want to read sometime in the future. I started this out as a single markdown document but as it got bigger and bigger it got harder to find stuff in, and thereby wasn't very helpful anymore, so I moved it to GitBook.
